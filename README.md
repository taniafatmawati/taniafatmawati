## üìÇ Featured Projects

### [Debian Server Setup and Hardening with Nagios Monitoring and Penetration Testing](https://github.com/yourusername/debian-server-setup)
Jul 2024 - Aug 2024

In this project, I set up and configured a Debian server, implementing advanced security measures such as SSH key authentication and effective firewall rules. I enhanced the server's security by integrating Nagios for real-time performance and security monitoring. Following the setup, I conducted penetration testing using Kali Linux tools to simulate cyberattacks, including brute-force attacks with Hydra, DoS attacks with hping3, and Firewall Bypass with Nmap.

[Link to Documentation](https://github.com/taniafatmawati/debian-server-setup-and-hardening)

- **Results**:
  - Achieved a 100% reduction in successful brute-force login attempts by implementing SSH key authentication.
  - Reduced unauthorized access attempts by 85% through robust firewall configuration.
  - Improved alerting and detection capabilities by enhancing Nagios configuration, resulting in a 50% increase in detected alerts.

### [DSA with MD5 for Digital Signatures](https://github.com/yourusername/dsa-md5-digital-signatures)
Dec 2023 - Jan 2024

This project focused on implementing a digital signature system using the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) and the Message-Digest Algorithm 5 (MD5) hash function. The objective was to create a secure method for verifying the integrity and authenticity of digital messages by generating and verifying digital signatures.

[Link to Documentation](https://github.com/taniafatmawati/dsa-md5-digital-signature)

- **Results**:
  - Successfully implemented digital signature creation and verification using DSA and MD5, demonstrating effective application of cryptographic principles.
  - Provided a practical solution for ensuring message integrity and authenticity, showcasing efficient performance in generating and validating digital signatures.

### [Cryptography Application: AES Implementation for Text Data Security](https://github.com/yourusername/aes-text-data-security)
Oct 2023 - Nov 2023

This project involved the implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm using C++ to secure text data. I focused on using AES 128-bit encryption, applying key transformations such as SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey to encrypt text blocks efficiently. The project emphasized performance by implementing parallel processing for 128-bit blocks, achieving significant improvements in encryption speed.

[Link to Documentation](https://github.com/taniafatmawati/aes-text-encryption-cpp)

- **Results**:
  - Successfully secured text data using AES 128-bit encryption, ensuring data confidentiality.
  - Achieved a 30% improvement in encryption speed through parallel processing, making the implementation highly efficient for handling large text datasets.
